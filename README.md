This project demonstrates a simple currency converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the ExchangeRate API to provide real-time currency conversion rates.

## Supported Currencies

The currency converter supports the following currencies:
- AED (United Arab Emirates Dirham)
- ARS (Argentine Peso)
- AUD (Australian Dollar)
- BGN (Bulgarian Lev)
- BRL (Brazilian Real)
- ... (and more)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text) to write and save your code

## Project Structure

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure for the currency converter.
2. **style.css**: CSS file for styling the converter.
3. **script.js**: JavaScript file responsible for fetching exchange rates and performing conversions.
4. **country-list.js**: Javascript file responsible for all storing all the country codes.

## How to Use
